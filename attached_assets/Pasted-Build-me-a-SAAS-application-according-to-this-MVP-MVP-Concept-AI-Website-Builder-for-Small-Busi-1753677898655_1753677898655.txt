Lose momentum when AI doesn't deliver what they expect

Need a jumpstart but don’t want to pay thousands upfront

Modify an existing template using AI instructions

Upsell path: hire a human expert to take over when things get complex.

⚙️ Functional MVP — Version 1
🛠️ Features
1. User Authentication
Sign up/login with email or social

Basic account dashboard (project history, account settings)

2. Website Creation Modes
Mode A: Template-Based Start

Browse a curated set of AI-generated websites (3–5 verticals to start: e.g., restaurant, personal brand, local service, online portfolio)

One-click duplicate + edit

Can be further modified via visual editor or AI prompts

Mode B: AI-Prompt Builder

User enters a short prompt: "I run a mobile car detailing service in Atlanta"

AI (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) returns:

Site title

3–5 page layout (Homepage, About, Contact, Services, etc.)

Hero content, service descriptions, calls-to-action

Simple styling (based on branding suggestions or default themes)

Mode C: Modify via Chat

On any site/template, user can say:

"Change the color scheme to dark mode"

"Add a testimonial section under the About section"

"Swap all images for stock photos of tacos"

AI generates diffs and applies to the code (or editable blocks)

3. Visual Editor (Basic)
Drag-and-drop or block-based editor (think Notion-like, not full Webflow)

Limited to:

Text blocks

Image upload/replace

Section reordering

Color/font changes

4. Deployment
One-click publish to a subdomain: username.autosite.app

Option to connect custom domain (manual for now)

5. Pricing Tiers
Free Tier:

1 website

Limited AI generations

Autosite subdomain only

Pro Tier:

Unlimited websites

Unlimited AI prompts per month

Connect your own domain

Priority support

Done-For-You:

Flat-rate service to finish/polish website for user

🧱 Tech Stack (Suggested)
Layer	Stack
Frontend	React + Tailwind (reuse for editor + dashboard)
Backend	Laravel (legacy) or migrate to Node.js/Express or Django
AI API	OpenAI (GPT-4) or Claude for text → HTML/content
DB	MySQL/PostgreSQL (persist templates, user sites)
Hosting	Vercel (for static sites), AWS/Render for app backend
CMS	Optional headless CMS layer like Sanity or Strapi

🧪 Prioritized User Stories (for MVP)
Priority	User Story
P0	As a user, I want to sign up, log in, and see a list of starter templates
P0	As a user, I want to select a template, preview it, and launch my site
P0	As a user, I want to enter a prompt and see a site scaffold generated
P1	As a user, I want to talk to AI to modify a section of my site
P1	As a user, I want to customize text, images, and order in a visual editor
P1	As a user, I want to upgrade to a pro plan to unlock more features
P2	As a user, I want to request help from a human expert

⚠️ Assumptions to Interrogate
“Users want AI to build their site”
→ Not always. Many want to edit and tweak, not just click once. Offer editable starting points.

“Prebuilt sites will keep users engaged”
→ Only if they’re well-designed and clearly matched to user goals. Test vertical-specific templates.

“AI alone can nail it”
→ It won’t. Blend AI speed with visual control or you’ll lose users in frustration.

🧠 Future Features (Post-MVP)
AI image generation (e.g., DALL·E for custom banners)

Branding assistant: logo + color palette generator

Simple contact form/email integration

E-commerce light (Stripe for 1–3 product stores)

SEO + social card auto-generation

AI site copywriting refinements

Usage analytics for site owners

🧭 Next Steps
Refactor or rebuild the backend?
→ Laravel may limit agility with AI integrations and editor complexity. A rebuild in a modern JS stack (Next.js + Firebase or Supabase) might give you longer runway.

Prototype 3 flows:

Choose & edit template

Prompt → site

AI modify existing site

Collect feedback fast

Launch free demo mode

Offer prebuilt demo sites for each vertical

Track where users drop off
